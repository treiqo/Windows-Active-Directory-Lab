<h1>Windows Active Directory Lab</h1>

This project documents my practical engagement with Microsoft Active Directory and Windows Server environments, as explored through the TryHackMe Windows and Active Directory room. It demonstrates foundational skills in Active Directory user and group management, understanding Group Policy Objects (GPOs), network services (DNS, DHCP), and common Windows Server administration tasks. This experience provides crucial insight into enterprise network infrastructure and account management, highly relevant for IT support and system administration roles.
