<h1>Windows Active Directory Lab</h1>

This project documents my practical engagement with Microsoft Active Directory and Windows Server environments, as explored through the TryHackMe Windows and Active Directory room. It demonstrates foundational skills in Active Directory user and group management, understanding Group Policy Objects (GPOs), network services (DNS, DHCP), and common Windows Server administration tasks. This experience provides crucial insight into enterprise network infrastructure and account management, highly relevant for IT support and system administration roles.

<br />
<b>Conclusion:</b>
 <br />
This hands-on experience has equipped me with the practical knowledge to navigate and manage an Active Directory environment. I am comfortable with the core administrative tools and understand the direct impact of my actions on user accounts, groups, and network security.
